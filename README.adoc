# The Choir Compiler Project

This repository contains the source code for the Choir, a compiler project primarily for the Laye programming language.

The Choir compiler project depends on https://github.com/nashiora/llvm-project[LLVM].
For the time being, you'll need to set up and build a copy yourself for Choir's build process to reference.

## Getting and Building Choir

First, follow the Getting Started instructions provided with https://github.com/nashiora/llvm-project[LLVM] and ensure you can build it in your environment.
